An "intent to use" registration allows you to reserve a trademark before it's used in commerce. After filing, you'll receive a notice of allowance and have six months to start using the mark, with an option for a six-month extension. Once in use, you must submit a specimen to the USPTO. Trademark registration protects your brand, allowing legal action against infringement, use of the trademark symbol, and facilitates licensing and international registration. Infringing on another's trademark can result in legal consequences, including fines and damage to reputation. A wordmark is a text-based logo that represents a company's name and is vital for branding. Official trademark registration provides nationwide legal ownership, public notice, and the right to sue for infringement, even in common law countries, and aids in international protection. Trademarks safeguard brand identity, prevent confusion, and build recognition, offering exclusive rights and legal protection.
While not required, trademarking your small business's name, logo, or slogan offers legal protection, prevents confusion, and enhances credibility. A trademark becomes a valuable asset, protecting your brand and supporting long-term growth. To qualify, a trademark must be distinctive, not generic or descriptive, and must not conflict with existing trademarks. It must also be used in commerce or have an intent to be used. A DBA name can be trademarked, providing exclusive rights to its use, but it must be unique and not already in use. Conduct a thorough search and pay the application fee, which starts at $350 for a single class.
Trademarks protect goods (e.g., Apple logo for products like iPhones), while service marks protect services (e.g., Uber logo for transportation services). Both undergo the same registration process, which typically takes 12-18 months. Trademarks last indefinitely if in use and maintained through required filings. Before using the TM symbol, conduct a trademark search to ensure uniqueness. The trademark registration process involves searching for conflicts, filing an application, examination, publication, and, if no oppositions arise, issuance of a registration certificate. When creating a trademark, avoid offensive language, generic terms, indistinguishable marks, and functional features to ensure successful registration.
Trademark protection is geographically limited to the country of registration and applies only to specific classes of goods or services. It does not cover generic or descriptive terms, and trademarks must be actively used in commerce to avoid cancellation. Enforcing trademark rights can be costly and time-consuming. In a trademark case, the plaintiff must prove the likelihood of consumer confusion due to the defendant's similar mark. To trademark a logo, conduct a trademark search, choose your filing basis (actual use or intent to use), complete the application with a clear representation of the logo and associated goods/services, and submit it with the required fees. Maintain the trademark by using the logo in commerce and filing maintenance documents.
A trademark protects a brand’s unique elements, like names, logos, and slogans, from unauthorized use, ensuring exclusivity in connection with specific goods or services. Examples include Nike's "Swoosh" and McDonald's golden arches. Trademark owners have the right to prevent infringement, take legal action, and license their mark for profit. Trademarking a name provides legal protection, enhances brand credibility, and increases business value. The cost of obtaining a trademark varies, with basic filing fees ranging from $250 to $350 per class in the U.S., and additional attorney fees if needed. Trademark registration offers brand recognition, legal protection, market differentiation, and the ability to enforce exclusive rights.
